# Develop

First of all, you need to learn this concepts of [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.dev).

It is recommended to use Github Codespaces for development, because the listened ports on Codespaces can be accessed directly from the public network, it's great for debugging.

and just run:

```sh
yarn
# Login to Cloudflare
yarn wrangler login
yarn dev
```

Then you should see the [deploy.md](./deploy.md).
